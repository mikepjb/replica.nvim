==============================================================================

replica.nvim is a Clojure REPL client plugin, that allows you to interact with
a clojure REPL from within neovim.

                                                 *replica.nvim-:Connect*
Get connected with `Connect <port>` or `JackIn <port`
see also `cpn` which is a shorthand for calling this.

                                                 *replica.nvim-:Eval*
:Eval {code to evaluate}
:'<,'>Eval (Visual select)

Eval with `Eval (+ 40 2)`
You can also evaluate by executing Eval after making a visual selection.

                                                 *replica.nvim-:Doc*
:Doc
Will use the nREPL/cider-middleware to get a definition for the current word
under your cursor. This is meant to be backup for `clojure-lsp` as it does a
good job here.

Sometimes you won't have the correct config for `clojure-lsp` and it won't
be able to find a definition (consult their docs!) and you can instead use
:Doc to avoid breaking your current workflow.
